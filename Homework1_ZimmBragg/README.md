The Homework1_ZimmBragg folder contains a Jupyter notebbok CBP_ZimmBragg.ipynb and an image file which is displayed in the notebook. 

The notebook presents a self-contained description of the code and of the computations results, which are and commented and discussed in detail. I recommend to download the notebook and open it in an environment that is capable of diplaying correctly images made with Plotly, since there are some interactive 3D plots.
